# React Memory Game
The project is for personal demonstration purposes

# Demo
https://memory-game-amber.vercel.app

## Description
The project demonstrates tools and approaches that I use.  
This application is bootstrapped with `Create React App` with `TypeScript` template.  
There are used:
- state management library `redux` with `@reduxjs/toolkit`
- code quality tools `ESLint`, `Prettier`, `Husky`
- `SCSS` Modules Stylesheet and `normalize.css` preset
- routing by `react-router-dom`

Also, I pay attention on code quality:
- folders and files structure
- descriptive variables names
- files size and separation
- correct filed TypeScript types
- maintainable and readable functions
- clean Git history with necessary commits
- UX and UI issues, flexible layout and mobile support

## Code quality tools

The project uses `ESLint` and `Prettier` to format code and check syntax.
You can configure rules in `.package.json` file.

The project uses `Husky`. It automatically applies validation and fixes to files before committing to Git repository.
